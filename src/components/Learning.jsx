    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School systems pose their own unique question: “How can people accurately judge the knowledge of another person”. The way they have (and continue to) answer this question is by ignoring the individual(student)’s knowledge all together and testing them merely on their performance.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Testing students based on their performance can vary wildly from what the students actually know. This becomes apparent when you look at people with anxiety or stress disorders who hear the sound of a pen clicking in a communal test room. The clicking could cause paranoia or distraction or any other things but it is just one example of how the standard performance based environment is not an acceptable answer for students.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems like the one mentioned above have led to the creation of Student Accessibility Services, available in a variety of different schools. These are excellent resources to have! For any individual student suffering with an individual ailment they will try to conform the system into one that is conducive to showing the true potential of their students. However, as beneficial and well intentioned as this system is, it treats the symptoms, not the cause.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A true opportunity for students to show their ability would arise only after steps are taken to ensure they are comfortable in their environment and make them actually perform. This sounds like what test taking is, but it’s actually meant to mean that students should be sent out as interns to the companies in their field of study and learn not only what will actually be applicable to them in their field, but also how effective they truly can be in the environment that they need to be in. It’s understandable that many workplaces may not have a ready made metric to judge people in comparison to their peers on a scale, but as a meritocracy goes, when people outperform their competition if it is scarcely apparent that there is a skill difference, the difference between them isn’t significant enough for their skill to be the deciding factor in the hiring process.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, assignments or tests given in school rarely match what will truly be required from them in the workplace. Despite school’s best efforts, the best way to learn has and always will be doing.</p>
